        <span class="news-item-title">Pixel 10a = Pixel 9a</span>
        <span class="news-item-date">February 19, 2026</span>
        <p>
            The Pixel 10a was released yesterday (February 18th 2026), and it's identical to the Pixel 9a except for slightly faster charging speeds. I have no idea why they released a near-identical phone other than to bump the number from 9a to 10a which could perhaps fool less knowledgeable consumers into buying the 10a for €550 instead of the 9a for significantly cheaper (~€350-400 as of today). 
            <br><br>
            At least anyone who buys the Pixel 10a gets an extra year of software support over the Pixel 9a but given the crappy Tensor G4 in them, I doubt Android 22 will be a very pleasant experience on the Pixel 10a. Heck, even Android 21 on the Pixel 9a (last supposed supported version) will probably not be pretty seeing how the Tensor G4 is only marginally more performant than the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 from the Year of Our Lord 2021. A 2026 phone with an SoC that performs roughly as well as a 2021 flagship - now that's what I call innovation :)
            <br><br>
            I suppose Google thinks it can pull off what even Apple didn't manage to pull off with its then-avant grade decision to stick yester-year's SoC in the iPhone 14 with it getting the same SoC as the iPhone 13 (albeit with an extra GPU core I think). The iPhone 14 didn't exactly sell like hot cakes unlike the current iPhone 17 which definitely is because surprise, people can actually notice the difference between 60Hz and 120Hz! Or maybe Google isn't thinking anything, knows that anyone who bothers to search "Pixel 10a" will know what they're doing but think they'll make more money selling a rebadged Pixel 9a with an extra year of software support instead of keeping the Pixel 9a for another year till the Pixel 11a comes out.
