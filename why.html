    <h1>Why This Website?</h1>
    <p>
      This website's reason for existing is to provide a digital space where I can rant and muse about stuff. As evidenced by the name, the main purpose is ranting about stuff (mostly tech) but I might add some musings about things I find interesting or noteworthy.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now you may ask... if it's just a place to record your musings:
      <ul>
        <li><b>Why not just write in your diary?</b> Well, I enjoy writing static webpages with HTML, CSS and maybe some JavaScript here & there.</li>
        <li><b>Why not use some blogging software and host it there?</b> See above :) The point is to let me write stuff quickly and if I feel like adding styling or other stuff, I can.</li>
        <li><b>Why is it a publicly accessible website?</b> So  that I can easily access it myself from different devices, work on it across different devices and share it with people I know.</li>
        
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      If you stumble upon this website and you have no idea who I am, then hi. If you're a web scraper, hello to you too I guess but I don't you'll find much that's particularly interesting to feed into your LLM or however you intend to use the data you scraped.

        <i>Inspired by ToastyTech, SoraNews24 and my personal predisposition towards ranting... it is indeed a personal hobby of mine even though not everyone likes it!</i>
